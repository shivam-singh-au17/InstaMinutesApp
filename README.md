# Some screenshots of our project

#### 1. This is the first view of my assignment where you can see all the stocks added by the user.

#### 3. The user can delete the added stocks here, the stock on which he hovers, a delete button appears on it, on clicking it, it gets deleted and buttons are also visible to shorten it here.

#### 4. If the user searches for a stock which he has already added to the watch list, he sees the delete button instead of the add button there.

#### 5. If the user searches for a stock that is not included in his watch list, he sees an add button when he hovers that stock.
